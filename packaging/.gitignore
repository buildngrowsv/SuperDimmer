# DMG Packaging .gitignore
# 
# WHY: The output folder contains generated DMG files which can be large
# and should not be committed to version control. They should be attached
# to GitHub releases instead.

# Generated DMG files
output/
*.dmg

# Temporary staging directories
staging/
temp/

# Build artifacts that might end up here
*.app/
build/
